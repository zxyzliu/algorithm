"""
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


Time complexity: Because, for each element, I try to find its complement by looping through the rest
of array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
